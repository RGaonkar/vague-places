Almelo;POINT(6.666666507720947 52.34999847412109);Netherlands;Almelo is a municipality and a city in the eastern Netherlands. The main population centres in the town are Aadorp, Almelo, Mariaparochie and Bornerbroek. Almelo has about 72,000 inhabitants in the middle of the rolling countryside of Twente, with the industrial centres of Enschede and Hengelo as close neighbours but also with tourist towns like Ootmarsum, Delden and Markelo only a bicycle ride away. Almelo received city rights in 1394. Within the city limits lies the castle of the Counts of Almelo. At the end of the 19th century textile emerged as a major employer and drew many workers to Almelo, at first from within the Netherlands. Since the 1960s workers from Spain and Turkey came to Almelo. The first mosque of the Netherlands was built in Almelo in 1976 for the Turkish population of the city. In the 1970s the industry dwindled and most factories were relocated to countries with cheaper labour. Some factories remain in the city centre and are now in use for apartments or offices. Currently, a major employer in Almelo is Urenco Nederland. This is a uranium enrichment plant which uses the gas centrifuge method and produces uranium with about five percent U-235, for nuclear reactors. A bakery factory, Bolletje, PANalytical, the Twenteborg hospital and the regional court are also major employers. Located in the city centre is Huize Almelo, a castle that in its current form dates back to 1662. There are mosaics which decorate the walls of the tunnel close to the railway station. The city is also known for its local association football club Heracles Almelo, who plays in the Eredivisie, the highest football league in the Netherlands.

It is located just west of Usselo. The village is known for the Military Boekelo Enschede, an international equestrian event. It is also known for the salt industry, since 1919 located south of the village. This was a reason for the then well-known Bad Boekelo (Bath Boekelo) to have a salt water wave pool. After the opening of the Twentekanaal (Twente canal) the factory of the Koninklijke Nederlandse Zoutindustrie (Royal Dutch Salt-industry) was moved to Hengelo; currently it is called Akzo Nobel. Textile industry flourished in Boekelo: The N.V. Boekelosche Stoombleekerij, founded in 1888 by Gerrit Jan van Heek, was taken over by Unilever (who fused it with P. Fenter van Vlissingen &amp; Co's Katoenfabrieken N.V.). On the former factory's terrain, a new quarter called De Bleekerij (The Bleachery) was built. Parts of the old industrial heritage such as old facades and the factory's chimney were integrated into the new buildings. The internationally known beer brewery Grolsch moved to Boekelo, abandoning its factories in Groenlo and Enschede. The Museum Buurtspoorweg (lit. Museum Neighborhood-railway) runs a historical museum railway with restored steam locomotives and wagons between Boekelo and Haaksbergen.

Usselo;POINT(6.832499980926514 52.20000076293945);Netherlands;Usselo is a Dutch village in the municipality of Enschede in the eastern Netherlands in region of Twente. It is located just west of Enschede and east of Boekelo. It has existed for over 800 years. Archeology shows that the region was inhabited more or less continuously since the last ice-age. The region is very fertile and will support agriculture and cattle. The countryside is marked by artificial hills, called es or esch, which were formed by depositing dung mixed with dirt. A prime example is the Fleringer Esch, near Fleringen. The village was one of the earliest settlements in the area. This was confirmed by finds of the remains of a prehistoric village (on the Usseler Es). During World War II the village was bombed by Allied fighters strafing the retreating German forces. This unfortunately led to casualties in the village bakery. The village has a Dutch Reformed church, a Church of the Christelijke Gemeente Nederland, a primary school and some shops. Of interest are the windmill (of the rare Stenderkast model), called Wissinks Ml ("Wissink's Mill"), and the Usseler Es, the man-made elevation forming the heart of the village farmlands. The village has a primary school, dating back to 1766 but now housed in a new building behind the Church. The newly-built Grolsch Brewery is located on the road to Boekelo. Usselo's rural landscape, notably its Es, has been transformed by encroaching housing and industry. Usselo, together with neighbouring Boekelo and Enschede, hosts the annual Military Boekelo Enschede, an international equestrian event usually held in October. The village is also notable for being the location of the novel, The Upstairs Room by Johanna Reiss. She was a Jewish girl taken into a family in Usselo while hiding from the German occupation during World War II. Further literary links consist of the poets H.H. ter Balkt, who was born in Usselo, and Willem Wilmink, who spent part of his youth in Usselo. Usselo observes the tradition of Noaberschop, which is the social framework governing relations in Twenthe.

Usselo;POINT(6.832499980926514 52.20000076293945);Netherlands;Usselo is a Dutch village in the municipality of Enschede in the eastern Netherlands in region of Twente. It is located just west of Enschede and east of Boekelo. It has existed for over 800 years. Archeology shows that the region was inhabited more or less continuously since the last ice-age. The region is very fertile and will support agriculture and cattle. The countryside is marked by artificial hills, called es or esch, which were formed by depositing dung mixed with dirt. A prime example is the Fleringer Esch, near Fleringen. The village was one of the earliest settlements in the area. This was confirmed by finds of the remains of a prehistoric village (on the Usseler Es). During World War II the village was bombed by Allied fighters strafing the retreating German forces. This unfortunately led to casualties in the village bakery. The village has a Dutch Reformed church, a Church of the Christelijke Gemeente Nederland, a primary school and some shops. Of interest are the windmill (of the rare Stenderkast model), called Wissinks Ml ("Wissink's Mill"), and the Usseler Es, the man-made elevation forming the heart of the village farmlands. The village has a primary school, dating back to 1766 but now housed in a new building behind the Church. The newly-built Grolsch Brewery is located on the road to Boekelo. Usselo's rural landscape, notably its Es, has been transformed by encroaching housing and industry. Usselo, together with neighbouring Boekelo and Enschede, hosts the annual Military Boekelo Enschede, an international equestrian event usually held in October. The village is also notable for being the location of the novel, The Upstairs Room by Johanna Reiss. She was a Jewish girl taken into a family in Usselo while hiding from the German occupation during World War II.

Usselo;POINT(6.832499980926514 52.20333480834961);Netherlands;Usselo is a Dutch village in the municipality of Enschede in the eastern Netherlands in region of Twente. It is located just west of Enschede and east of Boekelo. It has existed for over 800 years. Archeology shows that the region was inhabited more or less continuously since the last ice-age. The region is very fertile and will support agriculture and cattle. The countryside is marked by artificial hills, called es or esch, which were formed by depositing dung mixed with dirt. A prime example is the Fleringer Esch, near Fleringen. The village was one of the earliest settlements in the area. This was confirmed by finds of the remains of a prehistoric village (on the Usseler Es). During World War II the village was bombed by Allied fighters strafing the retreating German forces. This unfortunately led to casualties in the village bakery. The village has a Dutch Reformed church, a Church of the Christelijke Gemeente Nederland, a primary school and some shops. Of interest are the windmill (of the rare Stenderkast model), called Wissinks Ml ("Wissink's Mill"), and the Usseler Es, the man-made elevation forming the heart of the village farmlands. The village has a primary school, dating back to 1766 but now housed in a new building behind the Church. The newly-built Grolsch Brewery is located on the road to Boekelo. Usselo's rural landscape, notably its Es, has been transformed by encroaching housing and industry. Usselo, together with neighbouring Boekelo and Enschede, hosts the annual Military Boekelo Enschede, an international equestrian event usually held in October. The village is also notable for being the location of the novel, The Upstairs Room by Johanna Reiss. She was a Jewish girl taken into a family in Usselo while hiding from the German occupation during World War II.

It was here that the industrial revolution in the Netherlands took root. It has been said that Thomas Ainsworth (1795-1841) was one of its founding fathers, but this has not been confirmed. Textile production was the focus of industrial activity in Nijverdal, as it was for the rest of the Twente region. Some of the traditional factory buildings in the Art Deco or Jugendstil style still remain. A small river called the Regge runs through the town's centre.
Delden;POINT(6.711111068725586 52.26250076293945);Netherlands;Delden is a city in the Dutch province of Overijssel and, since 2001, in the municipality of Hof van Twente. Although its population is small, it gained city rights in 1333. Castle Twickel is a famous landmark near Delden and the Baron van Heeckeren of Twickel built a watertower in Delden. While drilling for water, the Baron's men discovered salt, which started the salt industry in the region of Twente. In 2009, the city had a population of 7,080. Before it became a part of Hof van Twente in 2001, Delden consisted of two municipalities: Stad Delden (the city itself), and Ambt Delden (the surrounding countryside). These municipalities had existed since 1818, when the original municipality "Delden" was divided into two parts. The town is served by Delden railway station on the line Zutphen-Hengelo.

Usselo;POINT(6.832499980926514 52.20000076293945);Netherlands;Usselo is a Dutch village in the municipality of Enschede in the eastern Netherlands in region of Twente. It is located just west of Enschede and east of Boekelo. It has existed for over 800 years. Archeology shows that the region was inhabited more or less continuously since the last ice-age. The region is very fertile and will support agriculture and cattle. The countryside is marked by artificial hills, called es or esch, which were formed by depositing dung mixed with dirt. A prime example is the Fleringer Esch, near Fleringen. The village was one of the earliest settlements in the area. This was confirmed by finds of the remains of a prehistoric village (on the Usseler Es). During World War II the village was bombed by Allied fighters strafing the retreating German forces. This unfortunately led to casualties in the village bakery. The village has a Dutch Reformed church, a Church of the Christelijke Gemeente Nederland, a primary school and some shops. Of interest are the windmill (of the rare Stenderkast model), called Wissinks Ml ("Wissink's Mill"), and the Usseler Es, the man-made elevation forming the heart of the village farmlands. The village has a primary school, dating back to 1766 but now housed in a new building behind the Church. The newly-built Grolsch Brewery is located on the road to Boekelo. Usselo's rural landscape, notably its Es, has been transformed by encroaching housing and industry. Usselo, together with neighbouring Boekelo and Enschede, hosts the annual Military Boekelo Enschede, an international equestrian event usually held in October. The village is also notable for being the location of the novel, The Upstairs Room by Johanna Reiss. She was a Jewish girl taken into a family in Usselo while hiding from the German occupation during World War II. Further literary links consist of the poets H.H. ter Balkt, who was born in Usselo, and Willem Wilmink, who spent part of his youth in Usselo. Usselo observes the tradition of Noaberschop, which is the social framework governing relations in Twenthe.

Boekelo;POINT(6.801944255828857 52.20444488525391);Netherlands;Boekelo is a Dutch village in the municipality of Enschede in the Eastern Netherlands, the population is estimated at approximately 2500. It is located just west of Usselo. The village is known for the Military Boekelo Enschede, an international equestrian event. It is also known for the salt industry, since 1919 located south of the village. This was a reason for the then well-known Bad Boekelo (Bath Boekelo) to have a salt water wave pool. After the opening of the Twentekanaal (Twente canal) the factory of the Koninklijke Nederlandse Zoutindustrie (Royal Dutch Salt-industry) was moved to Hengelo; currently it is called Akzo Nobel. Textile industry flourished in Boekelo: The N.V. Boekelosche Stoombleekerij, founded in 1888 by Gerrit Jan van Heek, was taken over by Unilever (who fused it with P. Fenter van Vlissingen &amp; Co's Katoenfabrieken N.V.). On the former factory's terrain, a new quarter called De Bleekerij (The Bleachery) was built. Parts of the old industrial heritage such as old facades and the factory's chimney were integrated into the new buildings. The internationally known beer brewery Grolsch moved to Boekelo, abandoning its factories in Groenlo and Enschede. The Museum Buurtspoorweg (lit. Museum Neighborhood-railway) runs a historical museum railway with restored steam locomotives and wagons between Boekelo and Haaksbergen.

It is located just west of Enschede and east of Boekelo. It has existed for over 800 years. Archeology shows that the region was inhabited more or less continuously since the last ice-age. The region is very fertile and will support agriculture and cattle. The countryside is marked by artificial hills, called es or esch, which were formed by depositing dung mixed with dirt. A prime example is the Fleringer Esch, near Fleringen. The village was one of the earliest settlements in the area. This was confirmed by finds of the remains of a prehistoric village (on the Usseler Es). During World War II the village was bombed by Allied fighters strafing the retreating German forces. This unfortunately led to casualties in the village bakery. The village has a Dutch Reformed church, a Church of the Christelijke Gemeente Nederland, a primary school and some shops. Of interest are the windmill (of the rare Stenderkast model), called Wissinks Ml ("Wissink's Mill"), and the Usseler Es, the man-made elevation forming the heart of the village farmlands. The village has a primary school, dating back to 1766 but now housed in a new building behind the Church. The newly-built Grolsch Brewery is located on the road to Boekelo. Usselo's rural landscape, notably its Es, has been transformed by encroaching housing and industry. Usselo, together with neighbouring Boekelo and Enschede, hosts the annual Military Boekelo Enschede, an international equestrian event usually held in October.

Almelo;POINT(6.666666507720947 52.34999847412109);Netherlands;Almelo is a municipality and a city in the eastern Netherlands. The main population centres in the town are Aadorp, Almelo, Mariaparochie and Bornerbroek. Almelo has about 72,000 inhabitants in the middle of the rolling countryside of Twente, with the industrial centres of Enschede and Hengelo as close neighbours but also with tourist towns like Ootmarsum, Delden and Markelo only a bicycle ride away. Almelo received city rights in 1394. Within the city limits lies the castle of the Counts of Almelo. At the end of the 19th century textile emerged as a major employer and drew many workers to Almelo, at first from within the Netherlands. Since the 1960s workers from Spain and Turkey came to Almelo. The first mosque of the Netherlands was built in Almelo in 1976 for the Turkish population of the city. In the 1970s the industry dwindled and most factories were relocated to countries with cheaper labour. Some factories remain in the city centre and are now in use for apartments or offices. Currently, a major employer in Almelo is Urenco Nederland. This is a uranium enrichment plant which uses the gas centrifuge method and produces uranium with about five percent U-235, for nuclear reactors. A bakery factory, Bolletje, PANalytical, the Twenteborg hospital and the regional court are also major employers. Located in the city centre is Huize Almelo, a castle that in its current form dates back to 1662. There are mosaics which decorate the walls of the tunnel close to the railway station. The city is also known for its local association football club Heracles Almelo, who plays in the Eredivisie, the highest football league in the Netherlands.

Usselo;POINT(6.832499980926514 52.20000076293945);Netherlands;Usselo is a Dutch village in the municipality of Enschede in the eastern Netherlands in region of Twente. It is located just west of Enschede and east of Boekelo. It has existed for over 800 years. Archeology shows that the region was inhabited more or less continuously since the last ice-age. The region is very fertile and will support agriculture and cattle. The countryside is marked by artificial hills, called es or esch, which were formed by depositing dung mixed with dirt. A prime example is the Fleringer Esch, near Fleringen. The village was one of the earliest settlements in the area. This was confirmed by finds of the remains of a prehistoric village (on the Usseler Es). During World War II the village was bombed by Allied fighters strafing the retreating German forces. This unfortunately led to casualties in the village bakery. The village has a Dutch Reformed church, a Church of the Christelijke Gemeente Nederland, a primary school and some shops. Of interest are the windmill (of the rare Stenderkast model), called Wissinks Ml ("Wissink's Mill"), and the Usseler Es, the man-made elevation forming the heart of the village farmlands. The village has a primary school, dating back to 1766 but now housed in a new building behind the Church. The newly-built Grolsch Brewery is located on the road to Boekelo. Usselo's rural landscape, notably its Es, has been transformed by encroaching housing and industry. Usselo, together with neighbouring Boekelo and Enschede, hosts the annual Military Boekelo Enschede, an international equestrian event usually held in October.

Usselo;POINT(6.832499980926514 52.20000076293945);Netherlands;Usselo is a Dutch village in the municipality of Enschede in the eastern Netherlands in region of Twente. It is located just west of Enschede and east of Boekelo. It has existed for over 800 years. Archeology shows that the region was inhabited more or less continuously since the last ice-age. The region is very fertile and will support agriculture and cattle. The countryside is marked by artificial hills, called es or esch, which were formed by depositing dung mixed with dirt. A prime example is the Fleringer Esch, near Fleringen. The village was one of the earliest settlements in the area. This was confirmed by finds of the remains of a prehistoric village (on the Usseler Es). During World War II the village was bombed by Allied fighters strafing the retreating German forces. This unfortunately led to casualties in the village bakery. The village has a Dutch Reformed church, a Church of the Christelijke Gemeente Nederland, a primary school and some shops. Of interest are the windmill (of the rare Stenderkast model), called Wissinks Ml ("Wissink's Mill"), and the Usseler Es, the man-made elevation forming the heart of the village farmlands. The village has a primary school, dating back to 1766 but now housed in a new building behind the Church. The newly-built Grolsch Brewery is located on the road to Boekelo. Usselo's rural landscape, notably its Es, has been transformed by encroaching housing and industry. Usselo, together with neighbouring Boekelo and Enschede, hosts the annual Military Boekelo Enschede, an international equestrian event usually held in October. The village is also notable for being the location of the novel, The Upstairs Room by Johanna Reiss. She was a Jewish girl taken into a family in Usselo while hiding from the German occupation during World War II. Further literary links consist of the poets H.H. ter Balkt, who was born in Usselo, and Willem Wilmink, who spent part of his youth in Usselo. Usselo observes the tradition of Noaberschop, which is the social framework governing relations in Twenthe.
